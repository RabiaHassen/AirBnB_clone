HBNB - The Console
This repository contains the initial stage of a student project to build a clone of the AirBnB website. This stage implements a backend interface, or console, to manage program data. Console commands allow the user to create, update, and destroy objects, as well as manage file storage. Using a system of JSON serialization/deserialization, storage is persistent between sessions.

How to use:

First clone this repository.

Once the repository is cloned locate the "console.py" file and run it as follows:

/AirBnB_clone$ ./console.py
When this command is run the following prompt should appear:
(hbnb)
This prompt designates you are in the "HBnB" console. There are a variety of commands available within the console program.
Commands
* create - Creates an instance based on given class

* destroy - Destroys an object based on class and UUID

* show - Shows an object based on class and UUID

* all - Shows all objects the program has access to, or all objects of a given class

* update - Updates existing attributes an object based on class name and UUID

* quit - Exits the program (EOF will as well)
